2. I have always been fascinated with the analysis capabilities of computers when they are populated with good data and pointed in the right direction.
  
3. I have taken courses (college and other) in programming in BASIC, COBOL, Pascal, C++, and little tidbits in Visual Basic and Java.  Outside of the classroom, programming is limited to simple routines, SQL statements, and macros to automated tasks.

4.  I have taken limited (not formal academics) statistics coursework only so as to apply the statistics to metrics and performance/process improvement projects under the umbrella of Lean Six Sigma.
5.  I have no experiance in R or Python.

6.  I am hoping to use the skills from this program to make better programmatic decisions based on predictive analysis, and eventually find a career specifically in data analysis.

7.  I am 46 years old and live in Onalaska, WI (vic. La Crosse) with my wife and 4 to 5 children, ranging in age from 4 to 17.  I have been working with or for the Army for nearly my entire life.  I spent just over a decade as an active duty intelligence analyst and another dozen years in the reserves.  For the past 15 years I have been a Department of the Army civilian security specialist and the Electronic Security Technical Manager (contractor) for the Army Reserves.
